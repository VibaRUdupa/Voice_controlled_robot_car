# Voice_controlled_robot_car
A voice controlled robot car's movement can managed through giving commands such as "10 left" meaning 10 cm to the left.

This is a basic arduino project. 
The robot car is built on a 2 wheel chasis available on amazon. 
Bluetooth module HC05 is used to connect it to a smartphone.
An Arduino-Bluetooth connector app available on playstore is used to communicate with robot.
Encoder wheels and LM393 speed sensors are used to measure the speed of robot and use it to monitor its distance travelled.
The concept of interrupts is used for measuring speed of robots.
